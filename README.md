   * Handwritten Digit classification using the entire MNIST Dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/  
   * The classification was implemented using a 3 layer neural network with 784 input units, 30 units in the first hidden layer, 20 in the second hidden layer, 10 units representing the ten digits in the output layer.  
   * Accuracy of about 97.7 % was obtained on the test set
